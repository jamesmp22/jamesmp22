### Hi there 

I'm making a portfolio to showcase my skills as they grow. 
I'm desiring to get into the cybersecurity industry.


Skills I'm currently trying to sharpen:
* Programming - I'm currently learning the basics of linux , then I will be moving into Python. (Ill be listing terms as I go)
* Tools - I'm working on making a File Integrity Monitor. Coming Soon!

* This is the very beginning of my portfolio, it will be refined over time.

* Feel Free to go to projects and view my Professional Statement.
