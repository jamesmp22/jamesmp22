### Hi there 

I'm making a portfolio to showcase my skills as they grow. 
I'm desiring to get into the cybersecurity industry.


Skills I'm currently trying to sharpen:
* Programming - I'm currently learning the basics of linux , then I will be moving into Python.
* Tools - I'm working on making a File Integrity Monitor. Coming Soon!
