This write up is purely from memory. This is my very basic guide on how to navigate in Linux

PWD enter - This will tell you where you are. Based on this you can go forward or backwards.

cd enter - This stands for change directory , you can use this command followed by the file name and enter , this will take you forward into that file.

cd .. enter - this will take you back. You can use this commands up until you just see a " / " 

ls enter - this will list the contents of the file you are directly on. 

cat enter - you can use this to read .txt files.
